I’m **Leo**. I`ve been coding my way through bugs by day and decoding minds by afternoon.  
Think of me as a **part-time developer, part-time psychologist, full-time curious human**.  

I like building things that mix logic with a touch of chaos ⚡️ —  
whether it’s wrangling Rust lifetimes, spinning up Go backends,  
or finding creative ways tech can make me have some quality alone time.
